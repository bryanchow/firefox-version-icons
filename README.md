I develop web applications, which requires browser compatibility testing in
multiple versions of Firefox. These are drop-in replacement OS X icons for
Firefox, so that I can quickly tell which version I'm looking at.

These are also useful if you need to run different versions of Firefox to
test for compatibility with specific plugins.

Currently, icons for Firefox releases 3.6 to 10 are included.
